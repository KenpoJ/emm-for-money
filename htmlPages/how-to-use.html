		<h2>How the Jar and EMM System Works</h2>

		<p class="lead">You may be familiar with the JARS System of money management taught by T Harv Ecker as part of his Millionaire Mind program. The system is simple and straight-forward. The idea is to separate your net income into six “jars,” or accounts. The money in each jar is committed to a specific purpose or goal.</p>

					<p class="card-text">10% of your income goes into this jar. This account is used for investment purposes. This will become your “golden goose,” providing a residual income in later years. One rule with this account: Don’t touch it! Let it grow.</p>

					<p class="card-text">10% of your income goes into this jar. This jar is just for what it says. Blow it each month on something fun. If you want you can let it build up for a couple of months to spend all of it on something a little larger. Movies, sports events, concerts, eating out, etc.</p>

			<h3>My Experience with the Jar System</h3>

			<p>When I first learned about the JARS System I wanted to try it immediately. However, when I looked at the amount of money I was bringing in and compared it to the percentages that I was supposed to put into each jar, that wasn’t happening. Our expenses were far more than 50% of my net income. So I had to modify the percentages, and the percentages would change with each paycheck because of different bills that were due at each time during the month.</p>

			<p>So, once all my expenses were added up I would put that much into my necessities jar, plus a few dollars extra. At the beginning it was sometimes 65 - 70 percent. It didn’t leave much, but the rest of the money I divided into the other jars. In the beginning it may have only been 20 or 30 dollars, but the important thing is to do it. As time goes on the amounts will grow, either by your income increasing or your ability to simplify your lives, and thus your expenses.</p>
